# Goal-optimization loop — experiment log

Approach (per direction 2026-06-25): **NOT per-dataset hyperparameter tuning** — that overfits the
benchmark and doesn't generalize. Instead, **diagnose why a rival wins, identify the algorithmic
technique behind it, and implement that technique as a genuine library feature** that helps broadly.
Every change keeps G0 (exact ≤3rd-order purified decomposition, all 5 I2 gates, `mode=Exact`) — so
leaf-wise/asymmetric growth and order>3 are off the table; value-level leaf methods, histogram/engine
engineering, sampling, bagging, categorical encoding, split-finding are fair game.

Metrics measured vs the **frozen rival baseline** (`.fair_cache.json`), across the whole suite — never
tuned to a single dataset. RMSE-log↓ (regression), ROC-AUC↑ (classification).

## Rival wins → technique gaps (the map the loop works through)
- **G1 (EBM)** beats tri at order-1/2 (main-effect shape quality). EBM technique: cyclic/round-robin
  per-feature boosting + heavy outer bagging + careful binning.
- **G2 (XGBoost/LightGBM @ d3)** beat tri on diamonds (fine-continuous; partly structural — leaf-wise is
  more expressive, OFF-TABLE) and amazon (all-categorical). Technique: native optimal categorical split
  (sort categories by gradient, split into 2 groups), quantile split candidates.
- **G3 (CatBoost d3-ctr1)** beats tri only on amazon. Technique: ordered target statistics / ordered boosting.
- **G5 (speed)** LightGBM 7–27× faster training. Technique: histogram subtraction, quantized hist, GOSS/EFB.

Note: **amazon (all-categorical) loses BOTH G2 and G3** → better categorical handling is the highest-leverage
single technique (closes two goals at once). A `rival-technique-roadmap` workflow is producing the prioritized,
G0-verified plan; entries below are filled as each technique is implemented + measured + committed.

## Aborted approach (recorded so it isn't retried)
- Per-dataset order-2 knob sweeps (lr/leaf_refine/l1/path_smooth/n_bags): confirmed single knobs *narrow*
  but don't *flip* diamonds/kick G1@2, and any "win" would be dataset-specific overfitting. Abandoned in
  favor of genuine technique adoption. (One real fact surfaced: miami G1@2 is a WIN under the committed
  gentle early stopping — a measurement correction, not a tuning gain.)

## Roadmap — rival techniques to adopt (from the rival-technique-roadmap workflow, all G0-verified)
ROI-ordered work queue; each is a genuine generalizing technique a rival uses that tri lacks.

| # | technique | source | goals | effort | G0 | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Per-split categorical gradient re-sort (Fisher optimal split) | LightGBM | G2+G3(+G1) | L | conditional | ❌ REJECTED by design (inert-or-invasive) |
| 2 | Histogram subtraction (parent−child), QuantizedI32-only | LightGBM | G5 | M | safe | queued |
| 3 | Integer-space quantized hist scan (unlocks #2) + QHIST default | LightGBM | G5 | S | safe | queued |
| 4 | Cyclic/round-robin per-feature boosting | EBM | G1 | L | safe | ❌ REJECTED (measured worse) |
| 5 | Automatic categorical CTR combination axes | CatBoost | G3+G2 | L | conditional | ❌ REJECTED (breaks G0 + doesn't generalize) |
| 6 | FAST pairwise interaction detection (populate InteractionPolicy.groups) | EBM | G1 | L | safe | queued |
| 7 | Hessian-weighted quantile bin borders | XGBoost | G2 | M | safe | queued |

Rejected (already present / G0-incompatible): EFB (g0=no, low impact); missing default direction (tri HAS it);
ordered TS (tri HAS it, KFold OOF beats Ordered{1}); ordered boosting (weak, leakage already closed); GOSS
(subsumed by MVS + #2); colsample_bylevel, heavy-bagging-default, mains-first, low-card one-hot (composable add-ons).

Sequencing: #1 first (multi-goal: amazon on G2+G3 at once). Then #3+#2 together (G5, cheap, mutually dependent).
Then #4 (suite-wide G1 order-1). #5/#6 compose with #4 (EBM's mains-first recipe falls out). #7 last. Re-measure
G5 after #2/#3 before bothering with GOSS. Every step: live G0 `tables()` check (FAIR_G0=o3) green before commit.

## Attempted techniques (with measured deltas vs frozen rivals)

### #4 Cyclic/round-robin boosting (EBM) — ❌ REJECTED, reverted (2026-06-25)
Built end-to-end (`Schedule::{Greedy,Cyclic}` core + FFI + sklearn + `.pyi` + round-robin-stump test,
all gates green, stays exactly decomposable order-1). Measured tri order-1 **cyclic vs greedy vs EBM mains**
across the 4 EBM datasets — **cyclic lost to greedy on ALL of them**:

| dataset | tri o1 greedy | tri o1 cyclic | cyclic vs greedy | greedy vs EBM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| diamonds | 0.11214 | 0.11663 | −4.0% | −4.4% |
| miami | 0.17139 | 0.17592 | −2.6% | −2.9% |
| kick | 0.76469 | 0.76424 | −0.06% | +0.2% (greedy beats EBM) |
| allstate | 0.56287 | 0.56421 | −0.24% | −0.2% |

**Why it failed**: forcing round-robin wastes rounds uniformly refining low-signal features, while tri's
greedy adaptively concentrates on high-gain ones — greedy is already a better mains learner. EBM's edge is
its bagging + tiny-lr shape smoothing, NOT the cyclic schedule. **Reverted** (no strictly-worse knob ships).
Corollary: the "compose cyclic with bagging/interactions = EBM recipe" plan (#5/#6 dependency on #4) is
weakened — if pursuing G1 mains later, test BAGGING on greedy mains, not cyclic.

### #5 Categorical CTR combinations (CatBoost) — ❌ REJECTED (2026-06-25, prototype only, no code shipped)
Python prototype (pairwise-concatenated tuple columns as ordinary TS axes). TWO disqualifiers:
1. **Breaks the decomposition rule.** A combo `a__b` is a 2-way original interaction smuggled in as a
   1-way axis, so the model is only ≤3rd-order in COMBO space — in ORIGINAL features, a combo inside a
   2-/3-way table is an order-4–6 effect presented as ≤3-way. Mechanically the I2 gates pass (combos are
   ordinary axes), but the ≤3rd-order-in-your-features guarantee (the product) is violated.
2. **Doesn't even generalize.** All-36-pairs amazon +1.63%; top-8-cats (28 combos): amazon +0.63%,
   **kick −0.74%**, allstate +0.08%. Helps one dataset, hurts another — dataset-dependent, not a technique.
Decision: do NOT ship. Pursue the G0-CLEAN categorical technique instead → #1 (per-split gradient re-sort:
sharpens single-categorical splits, no new features, no order inflation).

### #1 Per-split categorical gradient re-sort (LightGBM) — ❌ REJECTED by design analysis (2026-06-25, no code)
Architect design pass (read the full split/low_bit/explain architecture). Verdict: not worth building.
- **The cheap version is INERT on this suite.** Re-ranking categorical bins by ROUND-0 gradient ratio
  g/(h+λ) — the only variant that keeps the contiguous-split machinery (and all of explain.rs) untouched —
  equals tri's existing target-mean Fisher order for squared-error (gradient order == −target-mean order)
  and is near-identical for logistic. It changes nothing on diamonds/miami/particulate/allstate/kick/amazon.
- **The version that DIFFERS (per-level re-rank with current residuals) is disproportionately invasive.**
  It makes categorical splits NON-CONTIGUOUS sets in bin order, which breaks the shared `low_bit` primitive
  AND the merged-grid abstraction in explain.rs (`rep_model_bin`/`model_bin_to_cell`/`build_cell_maps` are
  pure contiguous-border arithmetic) — requiring a refined per-bin→cell merged grid, a SECOND serialized
  wire format for `TableBank.merged_grids`, a `Split` change, and exhaustive re-proof of all 5 I2 gates.
  ~2–3 weeks with high silent-G0-breakage risk.
- **Wrong target anyway.** Single-axis re-sort cannot capture amazon's TUPLE-interaction signal (the actual
  G2/G3 loss). Per the architect: neither variant addresses it.
Decision: skip. Pivot to the safe, biggest-gap, genuine technique → #2/#3 (LightGBM histogram subtraction, G5).

### #2/#3 G5 histogram subtraction (LightGBM) — ❌ REFUTED by profiling (2026-06-25, no code)
Before building it, profiled where diamonds fit-time (4000 trees) actually goes:
| config | time | acc |
|---|---|---|
| refine=4 + earlystop | 29.9s | 0.08896 |
| refine=0 + earlystop | 11.1s | 0.09070 |
| refine=4, no es | 29.1s | 0.08854 |
| refine=0, no es | 10.4s | 0.09047 |
| refine=0, n_trees=1000 | 2.5s | 0.09580 |
**leaf_refine_steps=4 is ~2/3 of fit time** (10.4→29.1s); early-stop eval is ~free (+0.7s); histograms are
the SMALLER ~10s base. So histogram subtraction (the roadmap's G5 technique, which assumed histograms
dominate) would yield ~7% overall — not worth 2-3 days. Also: QuantizedI32 is currently SLOWER than
FullF64 (diamonds 40s vs 34s) with identical accuracy (it dequantizes per-cell before the scan), so even
the prerequisite needs an integer-scan rewrite first. REFUTED. The real G5 cost is leaf_refine's repeated
full-row passes (aggregation + backtracking deviance); parallelizing them is blocked by the byte-determinism
invariant (needs fixed-order folds) and grad_hess is single-threaded (loss.rs) but trivial for squared-error.

## FRONTIER ASSESSMENT (2026-06-25)
After a rival-technique research workflow + rigorous attempts, tri-boost is at its **G0-constrained frontier**:
- **G1 (EBM)**: won @order-3 (3/4); @order-1/2 behind — EBM is a mains SPECIALIST (cyclic boosting tried →
  worse; bagging dataset-dependent). Structural.
- **G2 (xgb/lgbm d3)**: 4/6. Losses = diamonds (leaf-wise depth-3 strictly more expressive than oblivious —
  G0-forbidden to match) + amazon (tuple signal needs order>3 — G0-forbidden; combos break the rule + don't generalize).
- **G3 (cat d3-ctr1)**: 5/6. Loss = amazon (same tuple issue).
- **G5 (speed)**: coarse config-profiling shows leaf_refine ~2/3 of fit time (hist-subtraction refuted). NEXT:
  add GRANULAR per-phase timers inside the Rust fit (hist build / split-find / leaf_refine grad_hess /
  aggregation / backtracking deviance / update / early-stop) to pinpoint the EXACT bottleneck before optimizing.
Every clean rival technique either (a) reduces to what tri already does (inert), (b) requires breaking G0
(order>3 / leaf-wise / non-contiguous splits), or (c) is mature-implementation overhead. The real wins tri
HOLDS (G1@3, G2 4/6, G3 5/6, exact decomposition throughout) are already banked.

### Granular fit profiler (TRIBOOST_PROFILE env, zero-cost when off) — committed dev infra
Instrumented the Rust fit loop with per-phase wall-timers (boost.rs `prof` module). Diamonds o3
(refine=4, 4000 trees, wall 29.6s) EXACT breakdown — top-level phases sum to wall; nested `.` are subsets:
| phase | s | %wall |
|---|---|---|
| **leaf_refine** | 17.1 | 58% |
| ↳ refine.backtrack_eval | 8.9 | (30% of wall) |
| ↳ refine.grad_hess | 3.4 | |
| ↳ refine.aggregate | 0.9 | |
| **grow_tree** | 9.4 | 32% |
| ↳ grow.hist_build | 7.9 | (27% of wall) |
| ↳ grow.split_find | 0.4 | |
| update_raw | 1.1 | 4% |
| grad_hess | 0.8 | 3% |
| earlystop_eval | 0.1 | 0.2% |
**EXACT bottlenecks** (not the histograms the roadmap assumed): #1 `refine.backtrack_eval` (8.9s) — the
line-search re-walks the tree + does a separate deviance pass every trial, but memberships are FIXED and
only 8 leaf values change → fusable to one membership pass, O(8) exact for squared-error. #2 `grow.hist_build`
(7.9s) — where subtraction would help (~3s). Both exactness-preserving. backtrack_eval is the bigger, safer first win.

## Implemented techniques (committed wins)

### ✅ WIN #1 — Fuse leaf-refine backtrack eval (membership-based, no tree re-walk) [G5]
The profiled #1 bottleneck. The leaf-refinement line search re-scored the whole tree every trial via
`raw_with_tree_leaves` (route each row through the splits) + a separate deviance pass. But the leaf
MEMBERSHIPS are fixed and only the 8 leaf VALUES change per trial — so `raw[rows] = base_raw + leaves[membership]`
is computable with no tree walk, reusing one buffer. New `apply_membership_leaves` + a reused `trial_raw`
buffer (swap on accept). EXACTNESS-PRESERVING (byte-identical: a tree's contribution to raw IS its leaf
value; locked by test `membership_leaf_fill_matches_tree_walk_bit_for_bit`).
- **Measured (diamonds o3, profiler):** `refine.backtrack_eval` 8.93s → **4.14s (−54%)**; wall 29.6s → **24.7s (−17%)**.
- **Accuracy byte-identical** (diamonds 0.08896, allstate 0.54009 — exact). allstate wall neutral (histogram-
  dominated there, so backtrack is a smaller fraction). 221 core + 20 py + stubtest green; profiler confirms
  the saving internally (not wall noise). Generalizes: helps any leaf_refine>0 fit, hurts none.
NEXT G5 target (now #1 by profile): `grow.hist_build` (7.6s) — histogram subtraction on the quantized path.

### ❌ grad_hess row-parallelization — REVERTED (measured regression on SE)
Added a shared row-parallel `fill_grad_hess` (rayon `try_for_each`, threshold 8192) across all 5 losses.
Byte-identical across thread counts (✓ determinism), accuracy unchanged (✓), but **SLOWER**: diamonds
`refine.grad_hess` 3.36s → 4.88s, wall 24.7 → 26.4s. Squared-error grad_hess (g=raw−y) is MEMORY-BANDWIDTH
bound, not compute-bound — 4 threads can't beat one memory bus, and rayon coordination + closure-call
indirection add net overhead. Would help compute-bound losses (logistic/poisson `exp`/`sigmoid`) on huge
data, but regresses the common SE case and the benchmark can't validate the log-link gain. Reverted.
Lesson: only parallelize COMPUTE-bound per-row work, not memory-bound.

### ✅ WIN #2 — Eliminate leaf-refine's duplicate tree-walk [G5]
Leaf-refine walked the tree TWICE per tree: once for `tree_memberships_for_rows`, again for the initial raw
(`raw_with_tree_leaves`). The second is derivable from the first — the initial raw is `base + leaf[membership]`
(reuse `apply_membership_leaves`). Removed the second walk; `raw_with_tree_leaves` is now `#[cfg(test)]` (the
equality test's reference). BYTE-IDENTICAL (diamonds 0.08896). Diamonds wall 24.7s → **23.9s**. Generalizes
to every leaf_refine>0 fit. Cumulative with WIN #1: **29.6s → 23.9s (~19%)** on diamonds.

### ❌ `deviance_at_rows` direct-index fold — REFUTED, not committed (2026-06-25)
Hypothesis: `deviance_for_rows` (the leaf-refine backtrack + early-stop deviance) wastes 3 allocations + 3
gather-copies per call; fold deviance DIRECTLY over `y[rows[i]]`/`raw[rows[i]]`/`weight[rows[i]]` (new
`Loss::deviance_at_rows`, monomorphic per loss) to skip them. Built it across all 5 losses + a bit-identity
proptest (✓ byte-identical). **But measured SLOWER**: diamonds `refine.backtrack_eval` 2.585s → **4.560s
(+76%)**, kick 13.485s → **22.118s (+64%)** (fixed config n=2000, refine=4, no-es; scores byte-identical
0.09022 / 0.76975). Cause: the old gather-then-`deviance` folds over CONTIGUOUS slices → autovectorized
(SIMD); the direct-index fold reads scattered indices with per-element bounds checks → scalar. The removed
allocations were cheap (allocator reuses the same freed blocks); the vectorization I broke was not. Lesson:
**don't trade a contiguous SIMD fold for a scattered scalar one to save a cheap allocation.** Reverted whole.

### ✅ WIN #3 — Hoist trial-invariant gathers out of the leaf-refine line search [G5]
Salvaged the right win from the refuted attempt. The backtrack re-gathered `y`/`weight`/`raw` at `rows`
EVERY trial (scatter + alloc), then folded `deviance` over the contiguous result. But `y[rows]`,
`weight[rows]` and `base_raw[rows]` are CONSTANT across all steps + backtracks of a tree — only the 8 leaf
VALUES change. Gather those three into dense per-tree buffers ONCE (`gather_rows`); per trial just fill the
dense subset-raw from `base_sub + leaves[membership]` (`fill_leaf_raw_contiguous`) and run the SAME
vectorized `deviance` over contiguous `(y_sub, raw_sub, w_sub)`. Per-trial cost: one contiguous fill + the
SIMD fold — no scatter-gather, no allocation; the full raw is reconstructed (for the next grad_hess) only on
ACCEPT. Keeps the contiguous fold the refuted attempt lost. BYTE-IDENTICAL (`fill_leaf_raw_contiguous` ==
`apply_membership_leaves` gathered over `rows`, locked bit-for-bit in
`membership_leaf_fill_matches_tree_walk_bit_for_bit`; end-to-end scores unchanged 0.09022 / 0.76975).
- **Measured (fixed config n=2000, refine=4, no-es, 4 threads):** diamonds `refine.backtrack_eval` 2.585s →
  **1.530s (−41%)**, wall 12.5s → 11.9s; kick 13.485s → **12.107s (−10%)**, wall 43.2s → 41.9s. (Diamonds
  wins bigger: SE deviance is cheap so gather/alloc was a larger share; kick's logistic deviance is
  compute-bound, so the kept SIMD fold dominates.) Generalizes to every leaf_refine>0 fit.

### ⚪ Subset-only refine refactor (drop full-raw buffer) — NEUTRAL, not committed (2026-06-25)
Refactored the whole leaf-refine pass onto the dense subset buffers (grad_hess over `*_sub`, contiguous
aggregate, no full-length `raw` materialization, no `base_raw.to_vec()` per tree). BYTE-IDENTICAL (scores
unchanged). But measured NEUTRAL (within run noise): the o3 config has no row subsampling, so `rows == n`
and the subset grad_hess has the same row count, while the "scattered" aggregate over `gh[rows[i]]` was
already sequential (rows are sorted). It also narrowed grad_hess's finite-checks to in-sample rows (an
error-path change) for no speed payoff. Reverted — a cleaner shape with no measured benefit isn't worth the
semantic change. (Would help under bagging/subsample<1, which the benchmark doesn't use.)

### ✅ WIN #4 — Unit-weight histogram fast path (skip per-row Σw) [G5]
`grow.hist_build` is the largest phase outside leaf_refine (33-38% of wall, on every dataset). The hot
accumulation loop folds 4 arrays per row — g, h, **wsum**, count. But when the caller supplies NO sample
weights (the common case + the entire benchmark), the weight vector is the engine's materialized all-ones,
so `wsum[idx] == count[idx]` EXACTLY in f64 (Σ 1.0 over a bin = its integer count, exact for count<2^53).
A new `GrowConfig.unit_weight` flag (set iff `spec.weight.is_none()`) lets the histogram SKIP the per-row
weight read + Σw add (LLVM unswitches the loop-invariant branch) and set `wsum = count` afterwards. The
flag is conservative — `false` whenever weights were provided, even if all 1.0 — so it never risks a wrong
Σw. Subtraction/quantized paths untouched. BYTE-IDENTICAL: pinned bit-for-bit (g/h/wsum/count) for both the
sequential and row-chunk-parallel branches by `unit_weight_fast_path_is_bit_identical_to_full_sigma_w`;
end-to-end scores unchanged (diamonds 0.09022, kick 0.76975) across 3 reps each.
- **Measured (fixed config n=2000, refine=4, no-es, 4 threads; means of 3 reps):** diamonds
  `grow.hist_build` ~4.20s → **~3.90s (−7%)**; kick ~16.0s → **~14.4s (−10%)**. Wall diamonds ~12.5→~11.8s,
  kick ~41.9→~40.0s. Generalizes to every unweighted fit (the default), all objectives.

### ❌ Log-link grad_hess row-parallelization (retry, log-link only) — NET NEUTRAL, not committed (2026-06-25)
The prior `grad_hess` parallel revert (ea08b04) only tested squared-error (memory-bound). Hypothesis: the
LOG-LINK losses (Logistic/Poisson/Gamma/Tweedie) are compute-bound (exp/sigmoid per row, ~60-80 cycles), so a
row-parallel MAP (independent writes ⇒ bit-identical to sequential, no fold; SE left sequential) should help
kick/amazon. Built it (shared `fill_grad_hess` helper, threshold 8192, all 4 log-link losses) + a
1/2/8-thread bit-identity gate (✓ byte-identical). But measured NET NEUTRAL on kick: `refine.grad_hess`
3.73→3.13s LOOKED like a win, but the main `grad_hess` phase rose 0.22→0.79s (rayon pool warmup attribution)
— TOTAL grad_hess 3.95→3.92s unchanged; wall ~40.3→~39.0s (within noise). Cause: even with the sigmoid
compute, each call moves ~935KB (g/h write-out + y/raw/weight read) ⇒ memory-bandwidth bound on the write,
same as SE — the compute isn't heavy enough to overcome it. The prior SE lesson GENERALIZES to log-link.
Reverted. (Would only pay off if grad_hess were fused with more per-row compute, or on far wider data.)

### FRONTIER ASSESSMENT — byte-identical speed floor (2026-06-25, post WIN #3/#4)
After WIN #3/#4 and the refuted attempts above, the byte-identical + G0 speed frontier is reached for the
major phases. `grow.hist_build` (33-38% of wall, the largest shared phase) is **byte-locked**: its f64 fold
order (sequential-within-chunk + chunk-order reduction at the 32768-row threshold), f64 precision, and the
absence of subtraction are all baked into the committed bit-pattern — changing any of them changes outputs.
The leaf-refine line search (≈50% of o3 wall) is the accuracy lever LightGBM has no equivalent of; its memory/
alloc overhead is removed (WIN #1/#2/#3) and its compute (deviance fold, serial f64) is byte-locked. grad_hess
parallel is net-neutral (memory-bound) for ALL objectives. **Every remaining LightGBM speed technique violates
a hard constraint**: histogram subtraction (f64 drift ⇒ not byte-identical), quantized int histograms (changes
outputs), leaf-wise growth (needs fewer trees — G0 requires oblivious), no leaf-refine (drops the accuracy
lever). So tri stays ~1.9-3.5× slower than LGBM on the suite config (refine=0, hist-bound) and ~13× on the o3
accuracy config — a STRUCTURAL gap under strict byte-identity, not an implementation one. Closing it further
requires relaxing byte-identity (adopt subtraction/QHIST, accepting ~rounding-level output shifts) or G0.

### ✅ WIN #5 — Level-2 histogram subtraction (FullF64) [G5] — accuracy-neutral (byte-identity relaxed)
User authorized relaxing strict byte-identity for accuracy-NEUTRAL speedups. Wired the histogram-subtraction
trick into the oblivious grower: at level 2 (FullF64), build only the SMALLER of each parent leaf's two
children by accumulation (~half the rows) and derive the LARGER by subtracting from the retained level-1
parent (`subtract_sibling_into` + `build_subtracted_level`, gated by `GrowConfig.hist_subtraction`, default on,
kill-switch + A/B reference). Building the smaller and subtracting to get the larger remainder avoids
catastrophic cancellation, so g/h drift stays ~1e-11; `count` is integer-exact and, under unit weights (the
default + whole benchmark), `wsum == count` stays EXACT. Scoped to level 2 only (single drift generation) per
a design-critique workflow (3 expert critiques → synthesis); leaf values are recomputed from gh directly so
they are unaffected — drift only perturbs split SELECTION at exact near-ties.
- **Design + verification via Workflow** (ultracode): a design-critique workflow caught the axis-position
  remap (A_2 ⊊ A_1 positions shift), the `subtract()` shape-mismatch (needs a custom sibling-subtract), and
  the build-smaller-derive-larger cancellation-avoidance; an adversarial-verification workflow (3 attackers +
  triage) returned **ship, zero confirmed bugs** — the only flagged items were the accepted near-tie
  flip and a non-unit-weight credibility-boundary flip (absent under unit weights).
- **Byte-identity within tolerance:** equivalence test `level2_subtraction_reproduces_full_build_tree`
  (subtracted tree == full-build tree, well-separated fixture); determinism test (1/2/8 threads identical);
  primitive tests for `subtract_sibling_into` (hand-computed, underflow, shape); quantized-inert test.
  End-to-end real-data scores match the prior baseline **EXACTLY** (no near-tie flips occurred): diamonds
  0.11376 / 0.09022, kick 0.77228 / 0.76975. 229 core + 20 py tests green; clippy + fmt clean.
- **Measured (4 threads):** suite config (n=400, refine=0): diamonds `hist_build` 0.877s → **0.696s (−21%)**,
  wall 1.42s → **1.13s (−20%)**; kick `hist_build` 2.72s → **2.24s (−18%)**, wall 4.26s → **3.62s (−15%)**.
  o3 config (n=2000, refine=4): diamonds `hist_build` ~3.90s → 3.55s (−9%); kick ~14.4s → **11.6s (−19%)**,
  wall ~40s → 36.8s. Generalizes to every FullF64 depth-≥2 fit.

### ✅ WIN #5b — Extend subtraction to LEVEL 1 (parent = level-0 root) [G5] — accuracy-neutral
After the level-2 path was validated (equivalence + adversarial-verification workflows + exact real-data
scores), extended the SAME generic `build_subtracted_level` to level 1 (gate `level >= 1`; retain each
FullF64 level's hist as the next level's parent). Level 1 is the BIGGER win — it has the most admissible axes
(|A_1| = |A_0|−1, vs the shrunk |A_2|) over the full n rows, so subtracting it saves more row-visits than
level 2. Level 2's parent is now itself a subtracted hist ⇒ g/h drift compounds to ~2e-11, still
accuracy-neutral (the equivalence test grows the SAME tree as the full build for both levels; determinism
test green; real-data scores unchanged: diamonds 0.11376/0.09022, kick 0.77228/0.76975 EXACT). 230 core +
20 py green.
- **Measured (4 threads, cumulative subtraction total vs no-subtraction baseline):** suite (n=400, refine=0)
  kick `hist_build` 2.72s → **1.68s (−38%)**, wall 4.26s → **3.16s (−26%)** (vs LGBM 1.19s: 3.5× → 2.7×);
  diamonds `hist_build` 0.877 → **0.682s (−22%)**, wall 1.42 → 1.14s. o3 (n=2000, refine=4): kick `hist_build`
  ~16s → **8.66s (−46%)**, wall → 28.3s; diamonds ~4.2 → 3.26s. Generalizes to every FullF64 depth-≥2 fit.

### ✅ WIN #7 — Row-parallel log-link grad_hess [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL (corrects the earlier revert)
The earlier grad_hess row-parallelization was reverted as "net-neutral", but that verdict was a measurement
artifact: with a COLD rayon pool the first parallel call (the main `grad_hess`) absorbed the one-time pool
spin-up, which the profiler attributed to that phase and masked the refine-phase win. Now that WIN #6's
deviance work warms the pool, a clean re-test shows the real picture. grad_hess is a row-independent MAP, so
parallelizing it is **bit-identical** to the sequential loop regardless of thread count (no fold, no drift —
unlike the deviance) — pinned by `log_link_grad_hess_parallel_path_is_bit_identical_across_thread_counts`.
New `fill_grad_hess_parallel` applied to Logistic/Poisson/Gamma/Tweedie; **SquaredError stays sequential**
(g=w(F−y), h=w — a trivial per-row term, memory-bandwidth bound, where parallelism does not pay).
- **Byte-identical:** real-data scores unchanged (kick 0.76975; diamonds 0.09022, SE unaffected). 231 core +
  20 py green; clippy + fmt clean.
- **Measured (o3, n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads, warm pool):** kick `refine.grad_hess` 4.13s → **2.97s (−28%)**
  (no main-grad_hess regression this time), wall → ~26.2s; diamonds unchanged (SE sequential). Helps every
  log-link fit. Cumulative kick o3 this session: 37.1s → **~26.2s (−29%)**.

### ✅ WIN #8 — Array-of-structs histogram accumulator [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL
Profiling vs LightGBM (apples-to-apples suite config, refine=0): the gap is entirely in FIT (kick tri 2.88s
vs LGBM 0.91s; predict is fine), and `hist_build` is the dominant phase. The hot accumulation loop scattered
each row into 4 SEPARATE arrays (`g`,`h`,`wsum`,`count`) — 3 bounds-checked cell writes hitting 3 cache lines
per row (unit-weight skips wsum). Packed `g`/`h`/`count` into ONE `GhcCell` (array-of-structs) so each row is
a SINGLE bounds-checked write to ONE cache line; `wsum` stays a separate array (touched only for non-unit
weights). Same f64 arithmetic in the same fixed order ⇒ **byte-identical** (count/g/h/wsum per cell
unchanged); the existing hist + grow tests and exact real-data scores confirm it. Contained to `hist.rs`
(`AxisHist`, accumulate, `add_axis_hist`, assembly); the quantized path is untouched.
- **Byte-identical:** scores exactly unchanged (kick 0.77228, diamonds 0.11376). 231 core + 20 py green.
- **Measured (suite config, n=400, refine=0, 4 threads):** kick `hist_build` 1.88s → **1.45s (−23%)**, wall
  3.16s → **~2.77s** (vs LGBM 1.19s: gap **3.5× → 2.3×**); diamonds `hist_build` 0.77s → **0.58s (−18%)**,
  wall 1.14s → ~1.01s. Generalizes to every fit. Cumulative suite-config kick this session: 4.26s → ~2.77s (−35%).

### ✅ WIN #9 — Parallelize per-feature binning / categorical TS encoders [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL
Profiling the fit-vs-binning split (fit at n_trees=1 ≈ binning): kick's binning was a FIXED **~0.58s** — 64%
of LightGBM's ENTIRE fit — almost all of it the high-cardinality categorical target-statistics (KFold OOF)
encoders, run SEQUENTIALLY one feature at a time in `bin_train_columns`. Each feature's grid/encoder is
independent and deterministic in its own seed stream, so encode numeric grids and categorical TS encoders
with `par_iter` + order-preserving collects — **byte-identical** to the serial build (the categorical
(raw,id) uniqueness check is hoisted up front to keep first-duplicate-wins semantics). Contained to
`data/bin.rs`.
- **Byte-identical:** scores exactly unchanged (kick 0.77228, diamonds 0.11376). 231 core + 20 py green.
- **Measured (4 threads):** kick binning 0.58s → **0.30s (−48%)**, fit (n=400) 2.98s → **2.42s (−19%)**;
  diamonds binning 0.044s (numeric-only, already small). Helps every categorical-heavy fit (kick, amazon,
  allstate, …). Cumulative kick suite fit this session: ~3.9s → **2.42s (−38%)**.

### ✅ WIN #6 — Chunked-parallel log-link deviance fold [G5] — accuracy-neutral
With byte-identity relaxed, profiled the o3 bottleneck: kick `refine.backtrack_eval` (the leaf-refine
line-search deviance) was the single biggest sub-phase at 11.74s. The log-link deviance is COMPUTE-bound
(sigmoid + two `ln` per row ≈ 100+ cycles) — unlike grad_hess (sigmoid only, memory-bound, parallelization
was net-neutral / reverted). New `parallel_deviance_fold`: fixed-size row chunks each fold sequentially, then
combine the chunk partials in CHUNK ORDER ⇒ thread-count-INDEPENDENT (the §05.9 #7 gate holds, pinned by
`log_link_deviance_parallel_path_is_thread_count_independent` over 1/2/8 threads at n>chunk), differing from
a single linear fold only by ~1e-11 (chunked summation) — accuracy-neutral, only perturbs the line search at
an exact near-tie. Applied to Logistic/Poisson/Gamma/Tweedie `deviance`; **SquaredError stays sequential**
(cheap memory-bound term). Below the chunk size (8192) the sequential fold runs.
- **Byte-identity within tolerance:** real-data scores match the prior baseline EXACTLY (no flip): kick
  0.76975; diamonds 0.09022 (SE — unaffected, backtrack_eval 1.62s unchanged). 230 core + 20 py green.
- **Measured (o3, n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads):** kick `refine.backtrack_eval` 11.74s → **6.38s (−46%)**,
  wall 37.1s → **29.6s (−20%)**. Diamonds unchanged (SE sequential). Helps every log-link fit (kick, amazon,
  and Poisson/Gamma/Tweedie); the SE regression datasets keep their fast sequential fold. (NB: this is the
  reverse of the grad_hess lesson — there the per-row term was too cheap to beat memory bandwidth; the
  deviance's two logs make it genuinely compute-bound.)

### Re-baseline (2026-06-29, this machine, post WIN #9) — the next-target measurement
Re-measured both configs on the local box (faster than the cloud session — absolute seconds differ, phase
RATIOS guide the target). Build confirmed at HEAD: suite scores reproduce diamonds 0.11376 / kick 0.77228,
o3 scores diamonds 0.09022 / kick 0.76975 EXACTLY. o3 (n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads): kick wall 18.1s —
leaf_refine 9.81s (backtrack_eval 4.45 [parallelized], grad_hess 2.11 [parallelized], **init_dev 1.06**,
**members 0.68**, **aggregate 0.53**), hist_build 5.25s [subtraction frontier]; diamonds wall 9.9s —
leaf_refine 5.27s (grad_hess 1.56 [SE seq], backtrack 1.43, **members 0.62**, **aggregate 0.51**, init_dev
0.29), hist_build 2.68s. The untapped frontier is the leaf-refine SETUP cluster (members/init_dev/aggregate)
that commit 0e0ba6d instrumented — every other phase is either at the byte-locked subtraction frontier or
already parallelized.

### ✅ WIN #10 — Reuse grow's per-row leaf map in leaf-refine (eliminate refine.members re-walk) [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL
`refine.members` re-walked the whole tree per row (per tree × 2000 trees) to assign each row its leaf —
but `grow_oblivious_tree` ALREADY computes exactly that partition (`leaf_of_row`, set at its "Sample→leaf
update" loop via the SAME canonical `low_bit` the walk uses). Renamed grow → `grow_oblivious_tree_with_leaf_map`
returning `(tree, leaf_of_row)` (a `#[cfg(test)]` wrapper keeps the old name for the structure-only unit
tests — zero test churn); `refine_tree_leaves_after_grow` takes an `Option<&[u8]>` hint and GATHERS
`leaf_of_row[rows[i]]` instead of re-walking. The hint is passed ONLY when `sampled_rows.len() ==
train_rows.len()` (no subsample — `sample_rows(Full)` and MVS-with-`k==n` return the full set in train order,
so len-equality ⟺ grow saw exactly these rows); under subsampling it falls back to the walk (unchanged).
- **Byte-identical:** the gathered map equals the tree walk bit-for-bit (grow's bits come from the SAME
  `low_bit(bin, bin_le, missing_left)`, and `tree.splits` never changes after construction). Pinned by new
  unit test `grow_leaf_map_matches_tree_walk_memberships_bit_for_bit` (full rows + a reordered subset with
  repeats). Real-data scores EXACTLY unchanged (diamonds 0.09022, kick 0.76975). 232 core + 20 py green;
  clippy + fmt clean. Verified by a 3-skeptic adversarial workflow (byte-identity / gate-correctness / G0
  lenses) — **zero issues, unanimous SHIP**.
- **Measured (o3, n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads):** `refine.members` diamonds 0.62s → **0.046s (−93%)**,
  kick 0.68s → **0.061s (−91%)** — the tree re-walk is gone, leaving only the cheap O(rows) gather.
  Generalizes to every `leaf_refine>0` fit without row subsampling (the default).

### ✅ WIN #11 — Reuse grow's leaf map in `update_raw` (eliminate its per-row tree re-walk) [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL
The same redundant tree-walk as WIN #10, at the OTHER hot site: `update_raw` (apply the just-grown tree to
the running `raw`) walked the tree per row via `tree_value_for_row_with_columns` to fetch `tree.leaves[leaf]`.
Reuse grow's `leaf_of_row`: `raw[r] += tree.leaves[leaf_of_row[r]]` — byte-identical (grow's leaf bits come
from the SAME canonical `low_bit`, and leaf-refinement changed only leaf VALUES, never memberships). Gate is
STRICTER than members' because `raw` spans ALL n rows (incl. any held-out validation rows the early-stopper
scores, which `leaf_of_row` only covers when grow saw the full set): passed only when
`sampled_rows.len() == x.n_rows` (subsample OR a validation split ⇒ fall back to the walk, unchanged). Two
call sites (main + Nesterov correction).
- **Byte-identical:** new unit test `update_raw_leaf_map_matches_tree_walk_bit_for_bit` pins the leaf-map
  update == the walk update bit-for-bit over a non-trivial base raw. Real-data scores EXACTLY unchanged
  (diamonds 0.09022, kick 0.76975). 233 core + 20 py green; clippy + fmt clean.
- **Measured (o3, n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads):** `update_raw` diamonds 0.49s → **0.033s (−93%)**, kick
  0.64s → **0.043s (−93%)**. Cumulative WIN #10+#11 (members+update_raw, the two redundant tree-walks):
  diamonds wall ~9.9s → ~8.4s, kick ~18.1s → ~16.3s. Generalizes to every full-sample fit (the default).

### ❌ refine.aggregate parallelization — MEASURED SLOWER, reverted (2026-06-29)
The third setup-cluster item. The leaf-refine `aggregate` scatter-sums `gh.g[row]`/`gh.h[row]` into the 8
leaf accumulators over `rows` — 2 reads + 2 f64 adds per row (~1ns/row), and the `gh` arrays (≤464KB) stay
in L2 across the ≤4 refine steps, so it is L2-bandwidth bound. Chunked-parallel version (per-chunk `[f64;8]`
partials combined in chunk order, accuracy-neutral). **Measured SLOWER**: kick `refine.aggregate` 0.52s →
**0.757s (+46%)**, wall 16.3→16.9s (score unchanged 0.76975). Cause: ~65µs of memory-bound work per call
across ~8000 calls — rayon's per-call spawn/join overhead exceeds the split. Reverted. This is the loop's
**settled memory-bound lesson** (the twice-reverted grad_hess parallelizations) confirmed a third time: only
COMPUTE-bound per-row work parallelizes; a memory-bound reduction does not. (As a bonus it would have relaxed
byte-identity to a continuous ~1e-11 leaf-value drift — a worse trade than the deviance fold, which only
perturbs the line-search ACCEPT decision at a near-tie.)

### ⏸ refine.init_dev fusion — assessed, deferred (frontier; modest log-link-only win, invasive)
`init_dev` (kick 1.0s, diamonds 0.29s) is the deviance of the grown tree's leaves over `rows`, computed once
per tree before the line search. It is already a chunked-parallel compute-bound fold (`parallel_deviance_fold`,
the WIN #6 machinery). Two levers, both weak:
- **Overlap** (`rayon::join` it with the first refine `grad_hess`): net-NEUTRAL — both ops already saturate
  the 4 cores (`fill_grad_hess_parallel` + `parallel_deviance_fold`), so concurrently they just time-slice
  the same cores, no wall gain.
- **Fusion** (one pass computing g/h AND the deviance, sharing the sigmoid): byte-identical-achievable (chunk
  the fused pass by `PAR_DEVIANCE_CHUNK` and combine deviance partials in chunk order → bit-identical to the
  current `init_dev`; grad_hess is a map, unaffected). But the deviance's TWO logs remain (only the sigmoid +
  one memory pass over (y,raw,weight) are shared), so the win is PARTIAL (~0.3–0.5s on kick, ~0.1s diamonds),
  and it needs a new fused kernel across the 5 losses + a refine restructure (step-0 special case) +
  validation fallback. Disproportionately invasive for the payoff relative to the two banked tree-walk wins —
  deferred unless a log-link speed push is prioritized. The two CLEAN setup-cluster wins (the redundant
  tree-walks #10/#11) are banked; init_dev/aggregate are at the byte-identical+parallelism frontier.

### ✅ WIN #12 — Fuse init_dev into step-0 grad_hess (shared σ/exp) [G5] — BYTE-IDENTICAL (log-link)
(Built after the user prioritized the log-link speed push the assessment above flagged.) The leaf-refine line
search computes, at the grown-tree raw, BOTH the baseline deviance (`init_dev`) and step-0's grad/hess — two
passes recomputing the SAME link transcendental per row. New `Loss::grad_hess_and_deviance` does both in ONE
pass: a fused helper `fill_grad_hess_and_fold_deviance` writes g/h (the map, bit-identical to
`fill_grad_hess_parallel`) AND folds the deviance per `PAR_DEVIANCE_CHUNK` chunk combined in chunk order
(bit-identical to `parallel_deviance_fold`), computing σ/exp ONCE. Overridden for Logistic (shares the
sigmoid), Poisson (shares `exp(F)`), Tweedie (shares both F-exps); SquaredError + Gamma use a default
(unfused `grad_hess` then `deviance` — Gamma's `e^{−F}` g/h vs `e^{F}` deviance share nothing, SE is cheap).
- **Byte-identical, not merely accuracy-neutral.** refine uses the fused call for step 0 ONLY when
  `fuse_first = rows.len() == n_rows` — and `carve_validation_rows` returns `(0..n)` sorted when
  `validation_fraction` is None (else a sorted strict subset, len<n), so the gate ⟺ `rows == [0..n]` sorted ⟺
  the fused full-slice fold has the SAME values in the SAME order as the old gathered-subset fold (a validation
  split keeps the subset path). Pinned by `fused_grad_hess_and_deviance_is_bit_identical_to_separate` (all 5
  losses, n=20k > chunk, g/h + deviance bit-for-bit). Real-data scores EXACTLY unchanged (diamonds 0.09022,
  kick 0.76975). 234 core + 20 py green; clippy + fmt clean.
- **Measured (o3, n=2000, refine=4, 4 threads):** kick (Logistic) `init_dev + refine.grad_hess` 3.07s →
  **2.72s (−0.35s, −12%)** (init_dev now subsumes step-0 grad_hess; net drops by the shared sigmoid + one
  fewer memory pass), wall 16.3→15.9s. Diamonds (SquaredError, default) neutral, score exact. Generalizes to
  every full-sample log-link fit (Logistic/Poisson/Tweedie — the insurance objectives).

## G5 QHIST track — quantized-integer histograms (the remaining hist_build lever)

### FullF64 accuracy baseline across the suite (2026-06-29, n=400, refine=0, 4 threads)
The reference the QHIST path must not regress (RMSE-log↓ reg, ROC-AUC↑ clf):
| dataset | task | full score | full fit s |
|---|---|---|---|
| allstate | reg | 0.55744 | 11.7 |
| particulate | reg | 0.35804 | 15.6 |
| diamonds | reg | 0.11376 | 0.73 |
| miami_housing | reg | 0.16140 | 0.44 |
| amazon_access | clf | 0.85224 | 1.10 |
| kick | clf | 0.77228 | 1.83 |

### ✅ QHIST speedups (lazy-RNG + quantize-once + integer subtraction) — accuracy-neutral, NOT yet faster than FullF64
The existing `QuantizedI32` path was 1.5–2.6× SLOWER than FullF64 (and accuracy-neutral — the i32 scale
`i32::MAX·0.5/max|g|` is fine enough that split selection barely moves: Δacc ≤ 0.01% on every dataset). Three
fixes, all preserving the quantized path's existing determinism + accuracy:
- **lazy RNG**: `stochastic_round` computed a `pb_seed` hash per row but only USES it at an exact tie
  (`frac==0.5`); defer the hash to that branch — bit-identical, skips the per-row hash on ~all rows.
- **quantize once per tree**: `build_quantized_histogram` re-quantized the (tree-constant) `gh` on EVERY level
  (3×/tree); hoist `quantize_grad_hess` above the level loop — bit-identical, 3×→1×.
- **integer histogram subtraction**: subtraction was gated to FullF64; wire it for QuantizedI32 too (build the
  smaller children via quantized accumulation, derive the larger by subtracting the dequantized parent) so QHIST
  gets the same ~half-rows saving at levels 1+2. Pinned by `quantized_subtraction_reproduces_full_build_tree`.
- **Measured (n=400, refine=0):** QHIST speedup vs FullF64 went **0.39–0.66× → 0.66–0.86×** (allstate 0.41→0.78,
  diamonds 0.40→0.66, kick 0.39→0.74, miami 0.57→0.80, amazon 0.61→0.76, particulate 0.66→0.86). Accuracy still
  neutral (Δacc ≤ 0.01%). FullF64 scores byte-unchanged (the default path is untouched). 234 core + 20 py green.
- **Still slower than FullF64**, because FullF64 already has the AoS cache-packed accumulator (WIN #8) + unit-weight
  fast path, while the quantized accumulator is SoA (4 separate arrays) and pays a quantize + dequantize pass. NEXT:
  AoS-pack the quantized accumulator (apply WIN #8 to the i64 path) to close the per-row-scatter gap; the real 2×
  LightGBM win needs NARROW-integer (i16) histograms (more cells/cache-line + SIMD) — a bigger rewrite.

### ❌ FullF64 data-major histogram (read gh once, scatter to all axes) — MEASURED SLOWER, reverted (2026-06-29)
`build_histogram` is FEATURE-major (`axes.par_iter()` → each axis re-streams `gh`/`leaf_of_row` over all rows, so
the gradients are read `n_axes×`). Built the LightGBM-style DATA-major alternative: each row-chunk reads `(g,h,leaf)`
ONCE and scatters into all axes' bins, chunked by the SAME `ROW_PAR_CHUNK` with chunk-order reduction. Confirmed
**byte-identical** — swapping the axis/row loop nesting never changes a cell's f64 add order; pinned by
`data_major_matches_feature_major_bit_for_bit` (large fixture, both weight modes) + suite scores byte-unchanged.
Gated to `rows >= ROW_PAR_MIN_ROWS` (row-chunk parallelism), feature-major below.
- **Measured (suite n=400, best-of-2, vs HEAD):** NEUTRAL on diamonds/miami/particulate, but REGRESSED the
  high-cardinality sets: allstate 11.7→14.7s (**+26%**), kick 1.83→2.13s (**+16%**), amazon ~+7%. Revert restored
  allstate→11.98, kick→1.81. REVERTED.
- **Why it lost (hypothesis refuted):** the `gh` re-reads are CHEAP (gh fits L2/L3, so re-streaming is cache-resident,
  not RAM) — so data-major saves little. Meanwhile its per-chunk MULTI-axis buffer (`n_axes·n_leaves·max_bins`) is LARGE
  for many-feature datasets and spills cache, so the per-row scattered writes (one cell per axis) miss, where
  feature-major writes into a small per-axis buffer that stays in L1. No regime wins: small-buffer → neutral,
  large-buffer → regress. **Feature-major axis-parallel is the right design.**

### FRONTIER (2026-06-29) — FullF64 default path is exhausted for byte-identical/accuracy-neutral speed
This session banked the leaf-refine eliminations (members #10, update_raw #11, init_dev fusion #12) and rejected,
by measurement, the two remaining FullF64 levers: refine.aggregate parallelization (memory-bound) and the
data-major histogram (cache-buffer regression). `hist_build` (the 57–74% bottleneck) stays feature-major + AoS +
unit-weight + L1/L2 subtraction — at its frontier. The only un-banked speed lever is QHIST→i16 narrow-int
histograms (changes outputs; a substantial rewrite), deferred. The FullF64 engine is at its byte-identical floor.

### ✅ QHIST AoS accumulator + unit-weight skip (root-cause fix) — accuracy-neutral; ❌ i16 narrow-int rejected
A 3-angle design workflow found the REAL reason QHIST lost: `accumulate_axis_quantized` used a SoA accumulator
(`g/h/wsum/count` as 4 separate arrays = **4 cache-line writes per row**) with NO unit-weight fast path, while
FullF64 is AoS (`GhcCell`, 1 cache line) + skips `wsum` under unit weights. The i64 width gave zero density benefit.
- **Fix (kept):** AoS-pack the quantized hot cell into one `QHotCell{g:i64,h:i64,count:u32}` (mirrors `GhcCell`, one
  cache-line scatter), add the unit-weight `wsum`-skip, reduce per-chunk hot cells into the existing SoA i64
  `AxisQHist`. i32 quantization unchanged ⇒ **accuracy-neutral** (Δacc ≤ 0.01% on every suite dataset; determinism
  preserved — integer adds are associative). Measured QHIST speedup vs FullF64: **0.78→0.91 allstate, 0.74→0.82 kick,
  0.76→0.83 amazon, 0.66→0.68 diamonds** (suite n=400). 234 core + 20 py green.
- **i16 narrow-int (rejected):** also built it (scale to i16 range → dense 12-byte i32 cells, 2× denser than FullF64).
  Measured: NO extra speed over the i64 AoS (kick i16 0.74 vs i64 0.82 — i16 was actually SLOWER) because the per-axis
  histogram is already L1-resident, so denser cells don't help the scatter; AND i16's coarser quantization REGRESSED
  miami −0.23% (exceeds the accuracy gate). Reverted i16 → i32. The density hypothesis is refuted.
- **Conclusion — QHIST cannot beat FullF64 here.** Even at its best (allstate 0.91×, i.e. 1.1× slower) the quantized
  path still trails: the per-tree `quantize_grad_hess` pass is pure overhead FullF64 never pays, and the histogram
  scatter is already L1-resident so neither integer width nor density helps. In safe Rust (`forbid(unsafe)`, no
  hand-SIMD) the LightGBM 2× is not reachable on this workload. QHIST stays a non-default, accuracy-neutral path —
  now ~as close to FullF64 as it gets. Speed campaign is at its floor on BOTH precisions.

## LightGBM head-to-head + speed teardown (2026-06-29)

### Measured tri-boost vs LightGBM (matched depth-3, n=400, 4 threads)
tri-boost (refine=4, its accuracy lever) BEATS LightGBM on 5/6 — allstate 0.5435 vs 0.5500, particulate 0.3494 vs
0.3522, diamonds 0.09735 vs 0.09749, **miami 0.1395 vs 0.1599 (−12.7%)**, kick 0.7774 vs 0.7721 — loses only amazon
(0.8444 vs 0.8581, all-categorical). At refine=0 (no levers) LightGBM wins 5/6. **SPEED:** tri is **2.5–5.9× slower**
(refine=0), wider with refine=4. So tri trades training speed for exact decomposability + better accuracy on
interaction-heavy data.

### Teardown: a 4-agent workflow mapped LightGBM's speed to tri-boost
Verdict (all agents converged + matches the frontier assessment): the 2.5–6× is **~55–70% STRUCTURAL/unborrowable**
(leaf-wise growth reaches a loss in fewer trees — G0-forbidden since exact ≤3-order fANOVA needs depth-3 OBLIVIOUS
trees; plus tri's own leaf-refine accuracy spend LightGBM never pays), **~25–35% MICRO-ARCH** mostly behind
`forbid(unsafe)` (SW prefetch, bin packing — LightGBM's hot loop is SCALAR, NOT SIMD: bin scatter write-conflicts),
and only **~5–10% genuinely borrowable byte-identical**. Off-limits (stop chasing): leaf-wise (G0), prefetch/SIMD
(unsafe), int8/4-bin quantized (accuracy — i16 already failed), EFB/sparse-hist (inapplicable — tri TS-encodes each
cat to ONE dense axis), GOSS (subsumed by MVS).

### ✅/❌ Tested all 4 borrowable techniques — only #1 (degenerate-axis filter) kept; all ~ZERO on the benchmark
- **✅ Degenerate-axis pre-filter (kept, byte-identical):** `axis_is_admissible` now drops axes with <2 data bins
  (`n_bins ≤ 2`) — they were built (full O(rows) histogram) then unconditionally skipped in `best_level_split`.
  Byte-identical (scores exact on all 6). Speed: **0 on the benchmark** (no degenerate features here) — a correctness
  win for degenerate-feature/​rare-categorical production data, not for this suite.
- **❌ Count-free hot cell (spike, rejected):** the hist `count`/`wsum` are read ONLY by `best_level_split` under
  `check_cred` (leaf values recompute from `gh`), so on the unit-weight + inert-credibility default they're never
  read. Spiked out the per-row count write + the wsum=count pass: scores byte-identical (confirms unread), speed
  UNCHANGED within noise — `count` is same-cache-line as g/h (AoS `GhcCell`), so removing the write just overlaps
  memory latency. Reverted.
- **❌ HistogramPool buffer reuse (not pursued):** infeasible cleanly under the determinism gate — the fixed-order
  collect-then-reduce requires every per-chunk `AxisHist` to coexist (can't alias a reused buffer), and the only
  reusable buffer (the per-level assembly `Hist`) is O(cells)-tiny. The ~5–10% estimate didn't account for the
  determinism constraint + allocator block reuse (freed blocks are recycled, so the "churn" is bookkeeping not page
  faults). Net ≈0.
- **❌ Packed i128 QHIST add (not pursued):** an i128 add is 2 machine instructions on x86-64 (add+adc) = the same as
  two i64 adds, so ~0 net; QHIST already loses regardless.

**CONCLUSION: the borrowable ~5–10% is ~0 in practice on this benchmark.** Under tri's real determinism constraint +
the L1-resident scatter + same-cache-line AoS layout, none of the four recovered measurable wall-time. This
EMPIRICALLY confirms the teardown's verdict: **tri-boost's histogram engine is at its safe-Rust floor.** Further speed
requires relaxing G0 (off the table — it's the product) or `forbid(unsafe)` for a vetted prefetch/SIMD scatter (a
policy decision). The higher-value frontier is ACCURACY (G1 mains / amazon categorical), not speed.
