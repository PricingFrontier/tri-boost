//! The typed-error firewall — `PbError` + `Invariant` (spec §2.8 / §02.4, OWNED HERE).
//!
//! Every fallible public function in the workspace returns `Result<T, PbError>`;
//! no public signature uses `Box<dyn Error>` (enforced by the `check-no-box-dyn`
//! grep-gate). `PbError` is the single mechanism that keeps "no panics in library
//! code" a build `[GATE]` rather than a convention: the no-panic clippy deny set
//! (`unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/`unreachable`/`indexing_slicing`) leaves this enum as
//! the only way to surface a failure.
